# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide was created to serve as a destination for my notes for the coding bootcamp. 
It was created to help me gather and organize class notes to help me succeed in the bootcamp.
The organization and layout helps to make the various notes readable and organized.
Creating the study guide has helped me learn the basics of a web development stack.
